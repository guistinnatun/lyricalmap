In the newspaper article below, Roy Ringer writes about his visit to Downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row, where he witnessed a large degree of corruption. He notes that nightfall invited drunk men, prostitutes, drug dealers, and murderers to rebel on Main Street. Prostitutes swarmed bars and pubs in hopes that men would take them home. If they saw that a man was drunk enough, they would slip a pinch of charcoal hydrate in his drink to restrict his mobility, presenting an opportunity for the prostitutes to rob the man without engaging in sexual intercourse. Excluding these prostitutes, women were rarely found on Main Street at night. They knew better than to roam the area at this time because the women would become sexual prey. 

 Despite corrupt acts, such as selling drugs, the most prominent crime committed on Skid Row was murder. Several corpses were found in alley ways from armed robberies. One notable murder Ringer heard of was the stabbing of a twenty-seven year old man in a cheap hotel. No one witnessed this murder, yet rumors speculated that two men were overheard fighting in the hallway. The case remains a mystery and was never solved, leaving Ringer unsettled. 
 
Crimes and murders still occur today throughout Skid Row; however, this neighborhood now faces a larger problem, homelessness. Skid Row covers a fifty block area in downtown Los Angeles, and serves as a place for the homeless to congregate. “Of the estimated 91,000 homeless people living in Los Angeles County, it is estimated that 2,521 homeless persons can be found within the 0.4 square miles of the Skid Row area” (Salim 9). Those numbers equate to roughly three percent of the county’s entire homeless population. While this neighborhood represents a small fraction of the city’s area, it has “33% of the shelter beds available citywide” (Salim 9). Despite the availability of resources, homelessness still prevails on Skid Row.

Poverty and homelessness are not new phenomena in Skid Row. Even with advances in many areas such as technology, the sciences, and medicine, issues of homelessness continue to grow. Alcohol and drugs plague the streets at cheap prices, and at night, the entire neighborhood is filled with drunks, prostitutes, and drug abusers. Many women work in the bars or as prostitutes to maximize their income in order to survive. It is also not uncommon for murders to occur on the streets since they usually result from petty thefts; however, it seems that drugs and alcohol often correlate to the high number of homeless people living in Skid Row. 

One sentence in the newspaper clipping states, “... most of Skid Row’s population is dead drunk a large part of the time, capable of sudden, unreasoning violence.” Although this newspaper was written in the late 19th century, this fact remains true to this day. For decades, the population of Skid Row has included an overwhelming number of alcoholics. As stated in the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, “during the Great Depression, many people who were addicted to alcohol went to live in the cheap hotels on Skid Row.” When the city’s buildings and hotels were demolished, those alcoholics went to live on the streets. That is why about “thirty percent of the Skid Row homeless population suffers from alcoholism” (International Journal for Alcoholics Anonymous). So, even though technology and science improved throughout the years, the rate of homelessness in Skid Row is incomparable, especially when drugs and alcohol reign the streets. 

The past corruption in Skid Row has now led to a growing issue that prevails today, homelessness. There are strong efforts to combat this problem; however, the solution to this is not simple. Surely though, in the future, the mishaps on Skid Row will dissipate, which in theory would lead to less people on the streets and a safer community.
